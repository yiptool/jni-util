JNI Util
========

This is the small library of convenient C++ wrappers for Java Native Interface.

By default this library is meaningful only on Android. To use it on other platforms,
define the USE_JNI_UTIL preprocessor directive in your `Yipfile`.


Compiling this library
----------------------

This library is not intended to be built directly. Instead it is supposed
to be included into projects using the [Yip](https://github.com/yiptool/yip.git).

Use the `import jni-util` directive in your `Yipfile` to use this library.
